# Discovery Workflow

## Purpose
Initial PDF analysis and golden map creation using GLM4.5V vision detection and collaborative validation.

## Process Overview
1. PDF ingestion and preprocessing
2. GLM4.5V field detection with sections-references integration
3. Coordinate validation with ±0.5 pixel tolerance
4. Golden map generation and caching
5. Quality assurance and approval

## Key Agents Involved
- **PDF Vision Agent**: Primary field detection and analysis
- **Coordinate Validation Agent**: Quality assurance and validation
- **Golden Map Cache Agent**: Performance optimization and caching

## Expected Outputs
- Validated golden map with field coordinates
- Quality assurance report
- Performance metrics
- Cache optimization recommendations

## Success Criteria
- Field detection accuracy: 99.9%
- Coordinate precision: ±0.5 pixels
- Processing time: <5 seconds per page
- Cache hit rate improvement: >99.8%
